/* We want to add a box sizing of border box.
So what this means is anytime that you add padding to any element, what can happen is that padding
will stretch the page.
So let's say that you had a page that was 100 percent of The View ports with.
And if you added padding to something, it would make that more than one hundred percent and it would
force a horizontal scrollbar.
So what this does is it prevents that from happening because it prevents padding from adding extra width
or extra height to the page. */
